## 📂 Project File Structure Summary

The structure follows typical conventions, separating code into different logical directories:

### 🧩 Top-Level Folders/Files
These folders are standard for a Flutter/Dart project and often relate to build systems, platform-specific code, and project configuration.

| Folder/File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **.dart_tool/** | Files generated by the Dart tooling. |
| **android/** | Android-specific code and resources. |
| **assets/** | Resources like images, fonts, or data files. |
| **build/** | Compiled application output files. |
| **ios/** | iOS/macOS-specific code and resources. |
| **lib/** | **Primary application source code (most important).** |
| **linux/**, **macos/**, **web/**, **windows/** | Platform-specific code for desktop and web. |
| **test/** | Unit and widget tests. |
| **pubspec.yaml** | Project dependencies, metadata, and assets configuration. |
| **main.dart** | The application's entry point. |

### 💻 `lib/` (Application Source Code) Structure

The core logic is within the `lib` folder, which is well-organized into modules, models, screens, services, and widgets.

#### 📝 `lib/data/models/`
This directory holds the **data models** for the application, defining the structure of the data used in the app (like objects received from an API or database).
* `flashcard.dart`, `flashcard.g.dart`
* `lesson.dart`, `lesson.g.dart`
* `quiz_result.dart`, `quiz_result.g.dart`
* `unit.dart`, `unit.g.dart`
> The `.g.dart` files suggest the use of code generation (like the `json_serializable` package) for tasks such as JSON serialization.

#### 🖥️ `lib/screens/`
This is where the **main user interfaces (UIs)** or pages of the app are defined. It's further organized into sub-folders based on feature/functionality:
* **Custom_Quiz/**: Code for the custom quiz creation and playing screens.
    * `custom_quiz_question_screen.dart`
    * `custom_quiz_screen.dart`
    * `custom_quiz_select_screen.dart`
* **Flashcard/**: Code related to the flashcard viewing and management screens.
    * `flashcard_main_lesson_screen.dart`
    * `flashcard_main_screen.dart`
* **Quiz/**: Code for the standard quiz flow.
    * `quiz_history_screen.dart`
    * `quiz_question.dart`
    * `quiz_result_screen.dart`
* **Top-Level Screens**:
    * `all_updates_screen.dart`
    * `credits_screen.dart`
    * `future_updates_screen.dart`
    * `home_screen.dart`

#### 🛠️ `lib/services/`
Contains classes that implement **application services** or business logic, often dealing with background tasks or platform features.
* `notification_service.dart` (Likely handles showing push or local notifications.)

#### 🖼️ `lib/widgets/`
Contains **reusable UI components** that are smaller than a full screen.
* `flashcard_item.dart` (A component to display a single flashcard within a list or grid.)

## 🔔 Daily Notification Reminder

To enable daily reminders:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_local_notifications: ^16.1.0
```

Example setup:

```dart
final FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin notificationsPlugin = FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin();

Future<void> schedulePeriodicNotification({
    required String title,
    required String body,
    required RepeatInterval interval,
  }) async {
    const AndroidNotificationDetails androidDetails =
        AndroidNotificationDetails(
          'periodic_channel',
          'Periodic Notifications',
          channelDescription: 'Periodic reminders for flashcard learning',
          importance: Importance.high,
          priority: Priority.high,
        );

    const NotificationDetails notificationDetails = NotificationDetails(
      android: androidDetails,
    );

    await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.periodicallyShow(
      0,
      title,
      body,
      interval, // e.g., RepeatInterval.daily
      notificationDetails,
      androidScheduleMode: AndroidScheduleMode.inexact,
    );
  }
```
